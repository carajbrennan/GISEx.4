### Libraries
### Libraries are essentially the software packages that provide the functions 
### That you will use to manipulate and change the data
# Tidyverse is a library that is used to manipulate data in an easy to use cross sectional approach
library(tidyverse)
#Tidy Census is the library that connects to the Census API and allows you to pull the data
library(tidycensus)
# GGPLOT2 is one of the most popular data visualization packages.  You can make maps and anytype of plot you might want
library(ggplot2)
# Hmisc is another library that helps with the data manipulation
library(Hmisc)
# SF is the simple features library that allows you work with the spatial datatype of simple features
library(sf)
# Leaflet Gives the base map
library(leaflet)
# Stringr
library(stringr)
# Allows us to export our leaflet map
library(htmlwidgets)

### Part 1 Finding your Census Variables
# First you will need to install your census api
# The census API should have been gotten from https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html
# using the census_api_key function here put in your api key.  
# If you want to not have to do this every time you want to download census data, then add the second argument of install=TRUE.  If you choose this, then you might need to restart R. 
census_api_key("a4075d14f0f4418fdc430de9238fe8bf52d29cdc")
#alternative would be census_api_key("YOUR API KEY GOES HERE", install=TRUE)


# Loading the Possible Census Variables -----------------------------------
# Now we need to load the variables to determine which ones would be the best for us.
# using the load_variables() function to load an dataframe that tells you the codes for the variables we want to extract.
# First we will load the American Community Survey (ACS) 5 year estimates 2016-2020(last available ACS with tidycensus).
# First argument is the year,second is the dataset (acs is the complete ACS dataset), and third is just left as cache=false
ACS<-load_variables(2020,
                    "acs5",
                    cache=FALSE)


# Check out what it brought back.  Looks like 27,040 observations of 3 variables
head(ACS)
# now lets open the dataframe and catch all the codes for the topic you are most interested in.
view(ACS)

  ### My Map

Variables<-c(PBP = "B17007_002", # Total (male and female) below poverty level
             MHV = "B25109_001", # Median Home Value
             Totalpop = "B01003_001") # Total Population


CountyMM<-get_acs(geography = "county",  #Defining the spatial scale
                variables = Variables, #grabbing the variables we defined previously
                survey = "acs5",      # survey we are pulling is the ACS 5 year estimates
                year = 2020,   # End year for the 5 year estimates- 2016-2020
                output = "wide", # data format wide (cross sectional)
                geometry=T) # Pulls the spatial data information with it.

head(CountyMM)

# summary() provides an overview of the data
summary(CountyMM)

# Notice how there is two numbers and columns for each of the variables? ex. MHIE and MHIM
# MHIE or the ones with an E on the end are the estimate, while the MHIM or ones with M are margin of error
# For the purposes of this lab we only care about the estimates
# Lets clean up this data a little bit before we go too far
# Here we are just pulling out the columns we care about using the indexing dataframe[,c("column name","etc")]
CountiesMM<-CountyMM[,c("GEOID", "NAME", "PBPE", "MHVE", "TotalpopE", "geometry")]
# Easy renaming of the variables
names(CountiesMM)[names(CountiesMM) =="PBPE"]<-"PBP"
names(CountiesMM)[names(CountiesMM) =="MHVE"]<-"MHV"
names(CountiesMM)[names(CountiesMM) =="TotalpopE"]<-"Totalpop"


### Setting up the color palletes
### To get the color schemes you will need to set these up
# The instructions have the different color palettes you can choose
# domain is the data that you want to create breaks for.  Here the domain for each of these is the variable
# n says the number of colors and breaks that you will need.  By making that 10 here we are making a color palette for deciles or 10%.
# Lowest values would be in the bottom 10% and highest in the top 10%
palPBP<-colorQuantile(palette = "viridis", domain=CountiesMM$PBP, n=10)
palMHV<-colorQuantile(palette = "RdYlBu", domain=CountiesMM$MHV, n=10)
palpop<-colorQuantile(palette = "RdBu", domain=CountiesMM$Totalpop, n=10)


### The Leaflet map
## Named map
